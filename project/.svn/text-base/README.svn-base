PinBall.java is a source file which is to be modified by the user to  
design a unique PinBall game. 
Classes were built to ensure each class was a module on its own, the 
classes were: 
Sprites.java - the fixed sprites the ball bounces off to gain points
 Menu.java - a menu bar at the top of the screen
 Launcher.java - the launcher pad the ball launches from at the start of the
 					  game
 PlayerForm.java - a form at the right hand side of the game which allows 
 					    the user to view his progress and pause, start the game
 Balls.java - the ball being used
 Paddles.java - the paddles used to deflect the ball away 
 PinBall.java - the gaming class 
 RunApp.java- used to run all the apps simulatanously. 
 In addition two interfaces were used Animate.java and Drawable.java. 
test_pinball is a shell script that compiles and runs the main method
the command ./test_pinball, at the shell prompt will run a test. 
In the case it is unavaliable or permission is denied the following command whill
% javac RunApp.java
